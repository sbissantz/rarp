# Git Guis

## gitk & git gui

First, run `homebrew install git-gui`. Then, test with (1) `gitk` and (2) `git
gui`. I prefer `gitk`. So I added an alias to my `.gitconfig`:

```
git config --global alias.visual '!gitk'
```

Note the exclamation mark (!). `!` is mandatory, because `gitk` is an external
command. Now you can run `git visual` and enjoy the visual git experience. But
what about `git gui`? Well, since you previously installed it just open a
terminal and run `git gui`. Figure out which works best for you and stick with
it. Ah, do not miss to share your experiences with me.
