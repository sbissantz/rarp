Consider reading the tutorials in the following order:

1. [setup.md](./setup.md)
2. [ssh.md](./ssh.md)
3. [git.md](./git.md) [version 1.0]
4. terminal.md (not started yet)[^1]
5. [connect.md](./connect.md)
6. [updates.md](./updates.md) [in progress]

[^1]: The `git` tutorial includes a couple of handy commands to operate with
  the command line. For now, those will do the trick.
