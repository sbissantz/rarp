## Tracking branches

`$ git checkout -b <branch> <remote>/<branch>`
`$ git switch -c <branch> <remote>/<branch>`

1. Git creates `<branch>` locally.
2. `<branch>` starts tracking `<remote>/<branch>` (upstream branch)
3. Git switches to `<branch>`

`$ git switch --track <remote>/<branch>`

1. Git creates `<branch>` locally.
2. `<branch>` starts tracking `<remote>/<branch>` (upstream branch)
3. Git switches to `<branch>`

Prerequisites: Git will only set-up a tracking branch, if (1) `<branch>` does
not exist locally yet and (2) `<branch>` corresponds to a unique name on
`<remote>`. 

## Remote tracking branch

If you want to set up a local <branch> to track the <remote>/<branch> then you
can hack the following formula into the machine:

```
git branch -u <remote>/<branch> <branch> 
```

Read it as: The local `branch` is set up to be the tracking branch for the
`<remote>/<branch>`. However, we should not neglect the little `-u` option
which is a shorty for `--set-upstream`. So a more direct translation would be:
Set up `<remote>/<branch>` as upstream branch for `<branch>`.

Besides, the snippet obviously comes in handy if the name of the local branch
differs from the one on the remote repository, for example:

```
$ git branch -u origin origin/new_features experimental
Branch 'experimental' set up to track remote branch 'new_feature' from
'origin'.
```

If you want to save yourself a little typing, then you can also an equivalent
shorty for above's snippet. This holds, if the branch on the remote should be 
tracked by a local branch with the same name. Then the snippet simplifies to.

```
git branch -u <remote>/<branch>
```

But thinking back (a few commits) the snippet implies, that there is already a
local `<branch>` which is capable to track `<remote>/<branch>`. So actually the
workflow two operations: first, setting up a local `<branch>` and make
`<remote>/<branch>` the upstream branch for `<branch>`. Or, to put it another
way, now `<branch>` tracks (is the tracking branch of) our `<remote>/<branch>`:

```
git branch <branch> 
git branch -u <remote>/<branch> <branch> 
```

The get a two in one version of the snippet you can use `switch` with the
`-c`option or `checkout -b`:

```
git switch -c <branch> <remote>/<branch>
```









Branch 'master' set up to track remote branch 'master' from 'origin'.




Obviously this is helpful, when you want to 

This seems redundant, since there are two `<branch>`es and if you the names are
equal





git branch -u origin/serverfix








## Pushing branches

There are three global option which might help with the upstream-branch
wrangling: `push.default upstream`, `push.default simple`, `push.default
simple`. The first one pushes the current branch to its upstream branch, the
second is like upstream but refuses to push if the upstream branchâ€™s name is
different from the local one and the last one pushes the current branch to a
branch of the same name. I stick with the second option, since I found this to
be the best default for me. But reed, e.g.
[stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23918062/simple-vs-current-push-default-in-git-for-decentralized-workflow)
for additional advice:

```
git config --global push.default simple

```
