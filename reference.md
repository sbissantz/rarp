## Tracking branches

`$ git checkout -b <branch> <remote>/<branch>`
`$ git switch -c <branch> <remote>/<branch>`

1. Git creates `<branch>` locally.
2. `<branch>` starts tracking `<remote>/<branch>` (upstream branch)
3. Git switches to `<branch>`

`$ git switch --track <remote>/<branch>`

1. Git creates `<branch>` locally.
2. `<branch>` starts tracking `<remote>/<branch>` (upstream branch)
3. Git switches to `<branch>`

Prerequisites: Git will only set-up a tracking branch, if (1) `<branch>` does
not exist locally yet and (2) `<branch>` corresponds to a unique name on
`<remote>`. 

## Pushing branches

There are three global option which might help with the upstream-branch
wrangling: `push.default upstream`, `push.default simple`, `push.default
simple`. The first one pushes the current branch to its upstream branch, the
second is like upstream but refuses to push if the upstream branchâ€™s name is
different from the local one and the last one pushes the current branch to a
branch of the same name. I stick with the second option, since I found this to
be the best default for me. But reed, e.g.
[stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23918062/simple-vs-current-push-default-in-git-for-decentralized-workflow)
for additional advice:

```
git config --global push.default simple

```
